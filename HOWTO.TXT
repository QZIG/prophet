create a next.config.js file or complete it with my file

in components folder you have WalletConnectionProvider.tsx
you can rename to js and remove types inside

in the _app.tsx file you can see how use the 2 components (import as you use to for WalletConnectionProvider)
<WalletConnectionProvider>
<WalletModalProvider>
